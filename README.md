1. Performance Evaluation Metrics & Thresholds
A. Matching Performance (Photo-to-Selfie Comparison)
Metric	Definition	Threshold
Face Match Score	Measures similarity between document photo & selfie.	≥ 85-90%
False Match Rate (FMR)	Probability of incorrectly matching two different people.	≤ 0.1%
False Non-Match Rate (FNMR)	Probability of failing to match the same person.	≤ 1-3%
B. Liveness Assurance Performance
Metric	Definition	Threshold
Liveness Score	Determines whether the selfie is from a real person or spoof.	≥ 99.5%
Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate (APCER)	Probability of spoof attempts passing as genuine.	≤ 0.5%
Bona Fide Presentation Classification Error Rate (BPCER)	Probability of genuine users being flagged as spoofers.	≤ 1%
2. Monitoring Frequency & Escalation Measures
Monitoring Frequency	Purpose	Key Metrics Tracked	Escalation Measures
Real-Time	Detect immediate fraud attempts.	Face Match & Liveness Scores, FAR, FRR.	Flag suspicious cases for manual review if anomalies occur.
Daily	Monitor authentication success/failure rates.	Failed vs. successful authentications, False Positives/Negatives.	If failure rates exceed 2x baseline, initiate incident review.
Weekly	Identify early signs of model drift.	Average scores & variability, Spoof attack trends.	Adjust acceptance thresholds or trigger data recalibration.
Monthly	Evaluate stability across different user segments.	FAR, FRR consistency, bias detection.	If systemic bias exists, initiate bias mitigation & retraining.
Quarterly/Semi-Annual	Comprehensive validation & fraud trend analysis.	Coefficient stability testing, OOT dataset validation.	If model degradation is found, retrain with updated fraud scenarios.
Annual	Ensure regulatory compliance (e.g., RBI KYC, GDPR).	Audit logs, fairness & ethical AI compliance.	If compliance gaps are found, adjust model to meet regulatory standards.
3. Escalation Actions for Threshold Breaches
A. Face Match Failure
If Match Score < 85%, prompt user for document re-upload or selfie retake.
If repeated failures occur, escalate to manual KYC review.
B. Liveness Detection Failure
If Liveness Score < 99.5%, guide the user to retake the selfie.
If failure persists, flag for fraud analyst review.
C. Fraud Detection Alerts
If APCER breaches 0.5%, introduce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for flagged users.
If sudden spikes in FAR occur, trigger a system audit and fraud investigation.
Conclusion
By implementing a structured performance evaluation and monitoring framework, the iProov fraud model ensures high accuracy, robust fraud detection, and regulatory compliance while minimizing false positives and user friction.

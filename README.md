The imagery data used for active threat management in iProov’s system is securely accessed and processed through various devices, including Android, iOS, and Web platforms. Data from these devices is captured during biometric authentication sessions, where users’ facial images are processed for identity verification. To access the imagery data securely, users connect via a Virtual Private Network (VPN), protected by a client certificate specific to the user and their device, along with username and password credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security. Once the connection is established, logs of all accessed imagery are securely collected and stored, ensuring compliance and providing an auditable trail for accountability.

For data extraction and transformation, iProov employs deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to process the captured facial images. CNNs are used to extract multidimensional features related to the user's facial behavior and contextual data, allowing the system to evaluate the authenticity and intent behind each transaction.

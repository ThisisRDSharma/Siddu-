The chart below shows an improvement in performance for Version 4 when compared to the current model.
The AUC for the model's scorecards is acceptable as per industry standards, reflecting its effectiveness in rank-ordering predictions. The AUC represents the likelihood that a randomly selected good record has a higher score than a randomly selected bad record. A C-statistic of 0.5 describes a random model, whereas 1 describes a perfect model.

Note: The AUC statistics presented are based on development assumptions and have not been validated with current data.

KS Statistic:

Based on development assumptions, the KS statistic aligns with industry standards, suggesting the model effectively differentiates between goods and bads. KS measures the distance between the distributions of goods and bads captured by the score, and it is particularly relevant in risk industry decision-making.

Note: The KS statistic is based on development assumptions and has not been validated with current data.
The numbers referenced in the model document are provided here .However, the data needed to validate these numbers is not available, making it impossible to independently verify their accuracy or performance.

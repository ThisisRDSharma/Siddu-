The model is tested on the validation dataset during the building process to ensure that the variables used do not overfit the development dataset. The dataset is split into development (60%) and validation (40%), ensuring that model performance remains nearly identical across both datasets.

To assess coefficient stability, the model is repeatedly re-estimated on different subsets of the development sample as well as out-of-sample (OOS) and out-of-time (OOT) datasets. This helps evaluate whether the relationships between variables remain consistent over different periods and samples.

Independent bank samples are monitored over time through data studies to track model stability and detect any shifts that may require recalibration.

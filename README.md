PSI measures how much the distribution of scores (or key variables) has changed over time compared to a baseline period. 
 low PSI is good because it shows stability, while high PSI is a warning sign that significant changes are happening in your population.
KS measures how well your model separates the "good" and "bad" outcomes (for example, low-risk vs. high-risk customers).

How It Works:
It looks at the difference between the cumulative percentages of the two groups across the range of scores.
a high KS value is good because it shows strong separation between outcomes, while a low KS value is a warning sign that your model isn't effectively distinguishing between the groups.

Bridger XG uses rule-based logic and advanced matching algorithms to screen and match input details such as names, date of birth, countries, ID numbers, addresses, citizenship, SSN, and phone numbers.

These details are compared against the lists available in XG 5, which include:

Global sanctions and enforcement lists to detect restricted entities.
Extensive PEP (Politically Exposed Persons) coverage to assess risks tied to high-profile individuals.
Profiled adverse media to flag entities linked to financial crimes or fraud.
SWIFT/BIC information for due diligence on financial institutions.
The rules are developed by the bank to automatically process list matches in a way that aligns with the bankâ€™s list screening program and risk profile. These rules leverage input, list, and match attributes from LexisNexis Bridger Insight XG searches to test for evidence of false positives. The Intelligent Match Decisioning System (IMDS) analyzes the results and determines a False Positive Confidence Score.

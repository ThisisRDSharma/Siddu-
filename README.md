**Green Threshold (Stable Distribution):**  
"Historically, the bank has used this PSI threshold to indicate that the population distribution remains stable and within expected variations. This threshold aligns with industry best practices for ensuring model performance and minimizing the need for recalibration."  

**Red Threshold (Significant Shift):**  
"Historically, the bank has used this PSI threshold as a trigger for potential concern, indicating a significant shift in the population distribution. This threshold follows industry best practices, signaling the need for further investigation and possible model recalibration."

### **KS Thresholds**  

**Green Threshold (Strong Discriminatory Power):**  
"Historically, the bank has used this KS threshold to indicate strong discriminatory power, ensuring the model effectively distinguishes between different risk segments. This threshold aligns with industry best practices for assessing model performance and reliability."  

**Red Threshold (Weak Discriminatory Power):**  
"Historically, the bank has used this KS threshold as a benchmark for poor model performance, indicating weak discriminatory power. This threshold follows industry best practices, signaling the need for model refinement or redevelopment."

### **AUC Thresholds**  

**Green Threshold (High Predictive Accuracy):**  
"Historically, the bank has used this AUC threshold to confirm strong model performance, ensuring high predictive accuracy. This threshold aligns with industry best practices for evaluating classification models."  

**Red Threshold (Low Predictive Accuracy):**  
"Historically, the bank has used this AUC threshold as an indicator of poor model performance, suggesting limited ability to differentiate between classes. This threshold follows industry best practices, highlighting the need for model improvement or reassessment."  





The Area Under Curve (AUC) analytical framework demonstrates rigorous stress testing capabilities through systematically defined thresholds for model degradation assessment. The established baseline AUC values serve as critical benchmarks, enabling precise performance evaluation across temporal periods against two strategic degradation parameters: 10% and 20% below the baseline threshold.
Model performance at the 10% degradation threshold represents moderate stress scenarios within the testing framework, illustrating the model's behavior under mild economic pressures. Performance at the 20% threshold characterizes severe stress conditions, validating the model's response under significant market volatility and economic pressure points.
The systematic quarterly evaluation structure (Q3 2020 through Q2 2022) facilitates sophisticated pattern recognition of seasonal variations and longitudinal trends, effectively differentiating between anticipated fluctuations and substantive stress conditions.


The AUC analytical framework evaluated across different time periods illuminates model performance through diverse stress testing scenarios. The established baseline AUC represents optimal performance, while the 10% and 20% degradation thresholds effectively capture distinct levels of economic pressure within the testing framework.

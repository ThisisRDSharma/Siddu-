Bridger XG uses rule-based logic and advanced matching algorithms to screen and match input details such as names, date of birth, countries, ID numbers, addresses, citizenship, SSN, and phone numbers.

These details are compared against the lists available in XG 5, which include:

Global sanctions and enforcement lists to detect restricted entities.
Extensive PEP (Politically Exposed Persons) coverage to assess risks tied to high-profile individuals.
Profiled adverse media to flag entities linked to financial crimes or fraud.
SWIFT/BIC information for due diligence on financial institutions.
The rules are developed by the bank to automatically process list matches in a way that aligns with the bankâ€™s list screening program and risk profile. These rules leverage input, list, and match attributes from LexisNexis Bridger Insight XG searches to test for evidence of false positives. The Intelligent Match Decisioning System (IMDS) analyzes the results and determines a False Positive Confidence Score.

These details are compared with WorldComplianceâ„¢ Dataâ€”a global repository maintained by LexisNexis Risk Solutions that contains various watchlists used for sanctions screening and risk assessment. The lists available in XG 5 include:


IBM Safer Payments is a real-time, rules-based fraud transaction monitoring system that leverages customer banking transaction data as its core development data for rule preparation. The FIS Analytics team performs trend analysis on previously confirmed fraud transactions received from clients. They isolate data on completed fraud and genuine transactions by running specific queries on historical transaction data.

Once a rule is written and stagedâ€”using queries on the existing fraud dataâ€”the team can simulate how many completed fraud or genuine transactions the rule would have fired on if it had been active at the time. This approach ensures that only effective and accurate rules are deployed for real-time monitoring. Essentially, the development phase here is about using detailed customer transaction information to pre-test and refine rules, rather than traditional software development.

The data source used for data preparation is the historical customer banking transaction data. This includes the transaction records provided by clients that detail both previously confirmed fraud cases and genuine transactions.


First of all, this is not a modelâ€”it's a rule-based engine. The rules are developed using historical customer banking transaction data. The rule syntax includes a combination of attributes designed to identify high-risk transactions and suspicious activity. These attributes include payment amounts, payee name, brand ID, transaction type, transaction time, frequency/velocity, account creation date, email fraud scores, and other consumer details. Since the customer banking transaction data incorporates these key attributes, it is highly relevant and appropriate for developing and testing the rules that drive the fraud monitoring system






Estimation Methodology for Sanction Screening Model
The XG sanction screening tool utilizes rule-based logic and advanced matching algorithms to screen customers against predefined watchlists. The model works through a structured approach involving entity comparison, match scoring, and false positive identification to ensure efficient and accurate screening.

1. Entity Comparison and Match Detection
XG compares input entities (customer-provided details) with screening list entities (watchlist data).

If the input entity matches a list entity, it is classified as a true match.

If an input entity appears similar to, but is not the same as, a list entity, it is classified as a false positive.

2. Match Confidence Score Calculation
To measure how closely an input entity resembles a list entity, XG assigns a Match Confidence Score ranging from 70 to 100.

The LexisNexis Search Core calculates a match score for each data element (e.g., name, address, date of birth).

For each entity, it identifies:

Best Match Attribute â€“ The attribute with the highest match score.

Best Score Attribute â€“ The highest match score assigned to any data element.

A high match score suggests a strong similarity between the input and list entities.

3. Identifying False Positives Using IMDS
Since sanction screening may produce false positives, the Intelligent Management Decision Support (IMDS) module applies predefined rules to assess whether a match is genuinely suspicious or an error.

IMDS calculates a False Positive Confidence Score ranging from 0 to 10.

This score is compared against a confidence threshold to determine if a match should be automatically classified as a false positive.

4. Intelligent Management Decision (IMD) Processing
When an alert is generated, IMDS provides an Intelligent Management Decision (IMD), which includes:

âœ… False Positive Confidence Score â€“ The probability that a match is a false positive.
âœ… Reason Codes â€“ Explanations for why a match was classified as a false positive.
âœ… Applied Rules â€“ The set of rules used in the evaluation.
âœ… Rule File (XML Format) â€“ A document containing all configured rules.

5. Rule-Based Evaluation for False Positives
IMDS determines false positives based on a rule file, which consists of:

Intercept: A baseline value representing the default likelihood of a false positive.

Rules: Each rule contains:

Condition â€“ A test that checks if an attribute meets specific criteria.

Coefficient â€“ A weight that adjusts the false positive confidence score.

Reason Code â€“ An audit trail explanation.

Each condition evaluates as True or False based on whether an entity attribute (such as name, address, or date of birth) meets a predefined threshold.

6. Attributes Used in IMDS
IMDS analyzes multiple attributes to assess potential matches. These attributes are categorized as:

ðŸ“Œ Input Attributes â€“ Describe the entities being screened.
ðŸ“Œ List Attributes â€“ Represent the entities stored in the watchlist database.
ðŸ“Œ Match Attributes â€“ Provide results from the LexisNexis Search Core, which calculates match scores.

Entities can be associated with multiple data elements, such as names, dates of birth, addresses, ID numbers, citizenships, and phone numbers. The LexisNexis Search Core assigns match scores to each data element and selects the best match based on the highest confidence score.



One key setting is the targeted good-to-bad ratio, which is set between 3:1 and 5:1. This ratio is used as a threshold to help minimize false positives by ensuring that for every fraudulent alert (bad), the system verifies that there are at least 3 to 5 legitimate transactions (good) under similar conditions.

The data used for creating rules is historical customer banking transaction data provided by the client. This data includes both confirmed fraud and genuine transactions. The FIS Analytics team runs queries on this data to perform trend analysis and isolate patterns in completed fraud cases versus genuine transactions. They then use this historical data to simulate how a new rule would have performed in the past. If a rule triggers too many false positives on this data, additional conditions are added to refine it.


The development data is a collection of past banking transactions that includes both fraud and non-fraud examples. This data is prepared through these simple steps:

Collect transaction records from the bank's systems
Separate the transactions into two groups:

Transactions that customers reported as fraud
Transactions that are genuine (not fraud)


Organize this data so it can be easily analyzed

This development data is then used to create fraud detection rules. When making a rule, analysts look at the fraud transactions to spot patterns. They test each rule against the development data to see if it catches the known fraud without flagging too many genuine transactions as suspicious. If a rule creates too many false alarms, they add more specific conditions to make it more accurate.

Run specific queries on this transaction data to isolate patterns
Conduct trend analysis on the confirmed fraud transactions to identify common characteristics
Organize this data so it can be easily analyzed

This development data is then used to create fraud detection rules. When making a rule, analysts run queries on the confirmed fraud transactions to spot trends and patterns. They test each rule against the development data to see if it catches the known fraud without flagging too many genuine transactions as suspicious. If a rule creates too many false alarms, they add more specific conditions to make it more accurate.




For data sampling, a random sampling method was applied to evaluate the performance of the production rules. Out of a total of 1883 rules in production, a random sample of 29 rules was selected for testing. During the sampled period, the actual total alert count was 23,270, while the sample accounted for 1,464 alerts, representing approximately 6% of the total.


Explanatory variables for fraud transaction monitoring are the attributes used to identify high-risk transactions and suspicious patterns. In our system, these variables include:

Payment Amounts: Unusually high or inconsistent amounts can indicate risk.
Payee Name: Helps verify whether the recipient is associated with known high-risk entities.
Brand ID: Links transactions to specific merchants or service providers with historical fraud indicators.
Transaction Time: Abnormal timing (e.g., off-hours) may signal suspicious behavior.
Frequency/Velocity: The rate or clustering of transactions can reveal rapid, repetitive activity.
Account Creation Date: Recently created accounts may be more likely used for fraud.
Email Fraud Scores: Risk scores assigned to email addresses based on past fraudulent activity.
Consumer Age: Can help flag anomalies when customer age deviates from typical patterns.



Explanatory variables in a rule-based fraud transaction monitoring system are the individual transaction or customer attributes that are used as criteria in rules to flag suspicious behavior. Hereâ€™s how the given attributes serve as explanatory variables:

Payment Amounts: Unusually high or inconsistent amounts can signal risk. Rules may flag transactions that exceed a typical threshold, indicating potential money laundering or fraud.
Payee Name: Comparing the payee name against known high-risk or blacklisted entities helps detect potential fraudulent transfers.
Brand ID: Transactions associated with a specific merchant or brand that has a history of high fraud rates can be flagged for further review.
Transaction Time: Out-of-hours transactions or unexpected timing patterns may indicate suspicious activity.
Frequency/Velocity: A sudden increase in the number of transactions or rapid successive transactions (velocity) may be a red flag.
Account Creation Date: New accounts might be used to perpetrate fraud, so rules can be set to scrutinize transactions from recently created accounts.
Email Fraud Scores: Email addresses with higher risk scoresâ€”perhaps due to previous involvement in fraudulent activitiesâ€”can serve as indicators of potential fraud.
Consumer Age: Age can correlate with risk; for example, transactions from very young or unusually old consumers may trigger additional checks if they deviate from the norm.




Assumption:
FIS has a feedback loop where tagged fraud cases are reviewed and analyzed to improve fraud detection rules. Once a transaction is identified as fraudulent, it is labeled in the system, and these cases are systematically assessed to detect fraud patterns and weaknesses in existing rules. Based on this analysis, fraud detection rules are refined or new ones are created, ensuring continuous improvement in fraud prevention measures.

Rationale:
This assumption is important because a lack of a feedback loop would mean that fraud detection rules remain static, making them ineffective against evolving fraud techniques. By continuously updating rules based on real fraud cases, the system can adapt to new fraud patterns, reduce false positives and negatives, and enhance overall fraud prevention. This process also improves operational efficiency by minimizing manual intervention and ensuring proactive fraud mitigation.

The customer banking transaction data, received from the client, contains both fraud and genuine transactions. Through the data filtering process, completed fraud and genuine transactions are isolated by running queries on the transaction data. Once filtered, rules are created by querying previously reported fraud cases, ensuring that rule development is based solely on historical fraud patterns rather than the entire dataset.


Data quality treatments have not been performed because built-in controls ensure a low-risk environment for data issues. Within the Zelle UI, predefined data field requirements prevent incorrect or incomplete transactions from being processed. Transactions that do not meet these criteria fail before reaching the Safer Payments environment.

Additionally, fully automated data flows ensure data moves through the system without manual intervention. Programmed data field parameters define what type of data can be entered in each field. Data type restrictions ensure fields contain only the correct format, such as numbers in an amount field. Dedicated monitoring continuously tracks data for accuracy.



As a product under FIS, IBM Safer Payments follows the three-year data retention policy established by FIS. This policy ensures compliance with regulatory requirements while maintaining historical transaction data for fraud detection and analysis.

In the production environment, the bank uses Zelle for digital payments, integrated within its mobile and online banking platforms. FIS, which owns both Zelle and IBM Safer Payments, manages the entire fraud detection process. When a Zelle transaction is initiated, transaction data is automatically collected from the digital banking channels. IBM Safer Payments then screens this data in real time using a rule-based fraud monitoring system. This managed solution ensures that every transaction is checked for suspicious activity before it is processed, with alerts generated if any risk is detected.


One key setting is the targeted good-to-bad ratio, which is set between 3:1 and 5:1. This ratio is used as a threshold to help minimize false positives by ensuring that for every fraudulent alert (bad), the system verifies that there are at least 3 to 5 legitimate transactions (good) under similar conditions.

Purpose & Scope

FIS IBM Safer Payments is used for real-time fraud transaction monitoring in the Digital Banking production environment.
It helps identify and mitigate fraudulent transactions as part of the fraud detection program.
Process & Review

The Digital Payments Fraud Team (FIS) reviews cases flagged by FIS IBM Safer Payments.
Cases are triggered when transactions show fraud indicators or have a history of fraud, as identified by the FIS team.
If a transaction is not fraudulent, the case is closed.
If fraud is confirmed, the affected account and any linked accounts are blocked.
Handling Suspicious Transactions

Some cases require further investigation before a final decision can be made.
In such cases, the Digital Payments Fraud Team (FIS) contacts the bank for additional validation.
Extra verification measures should be in place when the bank reaches out to customers to avoid engaging with potential fraudsters.
Response to Confirmed Fraud

If fraud is confirmed, the bank should:
Immediately suspend access to the Zelle profile.
Notify the Digital Payments Fraud Team (FIS) about fraudulent activity and any related transactions.
Ensure compliance with network participation requirements

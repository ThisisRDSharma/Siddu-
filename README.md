Modeling Approach: Logistic Regression
The logistic regression methodology was selected for this model as it aligns with both industry best practices and academic recommendations for binary classification problems, particularly in credit risk modeling. According to Rezac & Rezac (2011), logistic regression offers an optimal balance between performance, interpretability, and ease of implementation, making it a preferred technique in risk modeling across financial institutions.




Comparison with Alternative Techniques
Neural Networks:
While neural networks can model complex, non-linear relationships, they lack transparency, making them unsuitable for credit risk applications where interpretability is critical. Rezac & Rezac (2011) highlight that neural networks, while powerful, often fail to meet regulatory expectations for explainability.

GLM:
Logistic regression, as a specific case of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), is ideal for binary outcomes. Its simpler implementation and sufficient predictive performance make it a better choice for credit scoring applications, as noted in Hosmer & Lemeshow (2000), a reference cited by Rezac & Rezac (2011).

Decision Trees:
Decision trees, though capable of handling variable interactions, are prone to overfitting and instability, particularly with small datasets. Rezac & Rezac (2011) emphasize that decision trees lack the robustness and reliability needed for high-stakes financial applications.

Advantages of Logistic Regression
Ease of Implementation:
Logistic regression is computationally efficient and straightforward to implement, requiring fewer resources than more complex techniques like neural networks. Rezac & Rezac (2011) emphasize its widespread applicability due to these advantages.

Interpretability:
Logistic regression provides interpretable coefficients, which help stakeholders understand the contribution of each predictor variable. Rezac & Rezac (2011) cite this as a critical factor in regulatory compliance and decision-making.

Regulatory Compliance:
The transparency and interpretability of logistic regression align with regulatory standards, such as Basel II/III, ensuring its suitability for financial risk modeling.

Rigorous Justification for Logistic Regression

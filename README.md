**Green Threshold (Stable Distribution):**  
"Historically, the bank has used this PSI threshold to indicate that the population distribution remains stable and within expected variations. This threshold aligns with industry best practices for ensuring model performance and minimizing the need for recalibration."  

**Red Threshold (Significant Shift):**  
"Historically, the bank has used this PSI threshold as a trigger for potential concern, indicating a significant shift in the population distribution. This threshold follows industry best practices, signaling the need for further investigation and possible model recalibration."  

Let me know if you need any refinements!




### **KS Thresholds**  

**Green Threshold (Strong Discriminatory Power):**  
"Historically, the bank has used this KS threshold to indicate strong discriminatory power, ensuring the model effectively distinguishes between different risk segments. This threshold aligns with industry best practices for assessing model performance and reliability."  

**Red Threshold (Weak Discriminatory Power):**  
"Historically, the bank has used this KS threshold as a benchmark for poor model performance, indicating weak discriminatory power. This threshold follows industry best practices, signaling the need for model refinement or redevelopment."

### **AUC Thresholds**  

**Green Threshold (High Predictive Accuracy):**  
"Historically, the bank has used this AUC threshold to confirm strong model performance, ensuring high predictive accuracy. This threshold aligns with industry best practices for evaluating classification models."  

**Red Threshold (Low Predictive Accuracy):**  
"Historically, the bank has used this AUC threshold as an indicator of poor model performance, suggesting limited ability to differentiate between classes. This threshold follows industry best practices, highlighting the need for model improvement or reassessment."  

Let me know if you need adjustments!

Rule-Based Approach: The analytics team writes rules based on historical fraud trends.
Backtesting on Historical Data: They check how well these rules would have performed on past fraud/genuine transactions.
No Predictive Model Training: There is no mention of using statistical modeling, machine learning, or AI for fraud detectionâ€”just querying past data and applying rules.

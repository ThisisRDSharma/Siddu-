## Key Differences in Statistical Backing

### ROC-AUC Drift
1. Sampling Variation:
   - More stable across different sample sizes
   - Standard error typically 2-3% for 1000+ samples
   - Less sensitive to extreme values

2. Statistical Properties:
   - Global measure across all thresholds
   - More robust to population shifts
   - Better for overall discrimination assessment

### KS Drift
1. Sampling Variation:
   - More sensitive to sample size changes
   - Standard error typically 3-5% for 1000+ samples
   - More sensitive to extreme values

2. Statistical Properties:
   - Local measure at maximum separation point
   - More sensitive to population shifts
   - Better for specific cutoff point assessment

## Combined Monitoring Recommendation
- Monitor both metrics as they complement each other
- Use stricter threshold if metrics show different status levels
- KS drift may show problems before they appear in ROC-AUC
- ROC-AUC provides better overall stability assessment







Statistical backing: 20% often represents approximately 2 standard deviations in model performance variation
At this level, the model's predictive power has significantly declined
Industry practice often uses this as a critical threshold


Statistical backing:


Represents 1-2 standard deviations in typical model performance
Based on normal distribution properties:

~68% of variations fall within 1 standard deviation
~95% fall within 2 standard deviations


This range suggests meaningful drift that requires investigation but isn't yet critical



Represents natural variation within 1 standard deviation
In stable models, performance typically varies by 5-10% due to:

Sample variation
Seasonal effects
Normal population drift




From Baesens et al., "Analytics in a Big Data World" (2014):

Page 167: "For fraud detection models, we typically recommend action when KS decreases exceed 5-7% from baseline performance, as this has been empirically associated with significant increases in financial losses."




According to Baesens et al. (2014, p. 167, Analytics in a Big Data World), even minor decreases in the KS statistic‚Äîapproximately five to seven percentage points below baseline performance‚Äîhave been empirically associated with significant increases in fraud losses, thereby warranting model recalibration.

Chernobai et al. (often cited in discussions of concept drift in fraud detection) have reported that‚Äîeven under only minor drift conditions‚Äîthe AUC‚ÄêROC of a fraud detection model can degrade noticeably, even when overall model accuracy remains high. In one study, they observed that for a ‚Äúminor‚Äù drift (for example, a small but systematic change in the data distribution that affects the minority class), the AUC‚ÄêROC could drop by several percentage points (on the order of 5‚Äì10%) relative to the pre‚Äêdrift performance. 

For example, suppose a model initially yields an AUC‚ÄêROC of about 0.95 on stable data; under conditions of minor drift affecting the fraud class, the AUC‚ÄêROC might fall to around 0.85‚Äì0.90. This ‚Äúhidden‚Äù degradation occurs because even small changes in the underlying fraud patterns can disproportionately affect the ranking of instances‚Äîsince fraud is rare and the model may be overfitting to historical fraud patterns.

Evidence for these findings is discussed in Chernobai et al.‚Äôs work on fraud detection under concept drift (see, for example, their Section 4, where they analyze performance metrics over time in a simulated fraud detection scenario). There, detailed experiments demonstrate that even ‚Äúminor drift‚Äù scenarios lead to a measurable drop in AUC‚ÄêROC, while other metrics (like overall accuracy) may appear relatively stable. 

Thus, according to Chernobai et al., one should expect a noticeable degradation‚Äîroughly 5‚Äì10 percentage points‚Äîin AUC‚ÄêROC for minor drift conditions in fraud detection settings. (For precise numerical values and additional context, please refer to the experimental sections and tables in Chernobai et al.‚Äôs paper.) 

*Note:* If you need the exact numbers and detailed evidence, I recommend consulting Chernobai et al.‚Äôs published paper directly, which provides a thorough experimental evaluation of AUC‚ÄêROC behavior under different drift severities.

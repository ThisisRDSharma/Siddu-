 imagery flagged as high-risk represents an extremely small proportion of the total transactions, estimated to be 0.05% of the imagery processed through the platform. This limitation means that the data available for detecting and analyzing advanced or novel biometric attacks is significantly limited. Given the rarity of these high-risk incidents, there is a restricted dataset for training models and improving detection mechanisms for these sophisticated threats.

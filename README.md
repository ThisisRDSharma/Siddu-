 imagery flagged as high-risk represents an extremely small proportion of the total transactions, estimated to be 0.05% of the imagery processed through the platform. This limitation means that the data available for detecting and analyzing advanced or novel biometric attacks is significantly limited. Given the rarity of these high-risk incidents, there is a restricted dataset for training models and improving detection mechanisms for these sophisticated threats.
The development data used by iProov is highly relevant to its core modeling objectives of ensuring accurate biometric authentication and robust security threat detection. The metadata, which includes data like biometric test results, device information, and anti-spoofing test results, is vital for training and optimizing biometric models. This data enables the system to perform well across different devices and environmental conditions, ensuring the technology's accuracy and reliability. Imagery data, particularly high-risk imagery flagged during suspicious transactions, plays a crucial role in improving the modelâ€™s ability to detect novel biometric attack patterns and adapt to advanced spoofing attempts. These images are essential for training models to handle emerging security threats effectively. Additionally, alerts, which provide real-time data on system performance and security, are used to identify operational issues and potential vulnerabilities, ensuring that the models remain accurate and resilient. By continuously leveraging this development data, iProov can refine its authentication models, improving both security and user experience while adapting to evolving biometric threats.

The document authentication model verifies the authenticity of ID cards, passports, driver’s licenses, and digital identity tokens by analyzing images that include key elements such as barcodes, MRZs, and contactless chips. Input images must meet recommended specifications, including a resolution of at least 600 dpi, a glare score of 50 or greater, and a sharpness grade of 50 or higher. Supported file formats include BMP, PNG, TIFF, JPEG, JPEG XR, JPEG 2000, and HEIC. The model uses a database of over 3,400 document types for verification. Input documents must meet quality standards, with all essential elements clearly visible. Cropping should be minimized, and compression must adhere to established guidelines.

Sensitivity settings—high, normal, or low—control the strictness of authentication. High sensitivity reduces the risk of fraud but may reject more genuine documents, while low sensitivity improves acceptance rates but increases fraud risk. 
Direct Correlation Between Image Quality and Verification Accuracy: The accuracy of iProov’s results is highly dependent on the quality of the ID image provided by Acuant. If Acuant provides a low-quality image—whether due to poor resolution, misalignment, environmental factors, or damage—the resulting image will be unsuitable for iProov’s facial comparison, potentially leading to failed verifications or false rejections.

Failure or Compromise in the Verification Process: Without a clear, well-lit, and properly aligned ID image, the verification process cannot be completed successfully, compromising both the user experience and security. A reasonable image quality from Acuant is essential for iProov to function properly and accurately verify the applicant's identity through the selfie comparison.

Impact on Customer Experience: If Acuant’s ID scanning process results in low-quality images, legitimate users may be unable to complete the onboarding process or may face unnecessary rejections, leading to customer frustration and potential drop-offs from the onboarding flow.

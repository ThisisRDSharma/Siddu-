Vendor Electronic Systems:
Vendor electronic systems are used to transmit, process, or store scoped systems and data. These systems are managed under strict security protocols to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

Bank Systems:
Bank systems are not used to transmit, process, or store scoped systems and data. This distinction ensures that bank systems remain isolated from scoped activities, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data exposure.

Unique User IDs for Access:
Unique user IDs are assigned to all individuals requiring access to scoped systems. This ensures accountability and facilitates audit trails for access and activity logs.

Password Requirements:
Access to systems that transmit, process, or store scoped systems and data is secured by password protection. Password policies adhere to industry best practices, including complexity requirements and regular updates.

Remote Access:
Remote access to scoped systems is permitted but is safeguarded through multi-layered security measures:

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is mandatory for remote access to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.
This ensures that only authenticated and authorized users can access the systems remotely.

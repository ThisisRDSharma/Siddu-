Out-of-time validations were performed using data from various months and will continue to be conducted post-implementation to ensure the model's stability and predictive power.

C-Statistics were calculated for four scorecards, with the following results:

Scorecard 1: 0.634
Scorecard 2: 0.769
Scorecard 3: 0.700
Scorecard 4: 0.702
KS Statistics were calculated during ongoing monitoring for this model. The KS statistic for QualiFile Advantage V4 is 37.51.

PSI (Population Stability Index) is calculated monthly, and the data is actively monitored to detect any significant shifts in model performance.

The Drivers Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) is a 1994 federal law that:

Protects personal information in state DMV records, including SSN
Restricts who can access driver data like name, address, SSN, and license numbers
Only allows access for specific purposes like law enforcement or court proceedings
Imposes fines up to $5,000 per day for violations


The data extraction process involves collecting inquiries from Chex Systems' DD account risk screening products. Using proprietary consumer search algorithms, the method precisely matches and filters data to create a representative sample for model development

**Stress Testing Considerations for the Qualifile Model**

Stress testing is widely recognized as a best practice in model risk management. It involves evaluating a model's performance under extreme yet plausible adverse conditions to assess its resilience, identify potential vulnerabilities, and support informed risk mitigation decisions.

For the Qualifile model—which predicts chargeoffs within 12 months using historical chargeoff trends and behavioral analysis—stress testing would typically involve the following steps:

Scenario Development: Experts would craft adverse scenarios based on past economic downturns or hypothetical severe conditions. These scenarios are qualitative and aim to cover a range of extreme situations without relying on specific numerical thresholds.

Input Adjustments and Simulations: The model’s key inputs would be altered to reflect these adverse conditions. By simulating the model’s performance under these scenarios, one could evaluate how sensitive its predictions are to significant shifts in underlying variables.

Performance Evaluation: The outcomes would be analyzed to determine if the model's predictions remain robust. This includes identifying which inputs drive the greatest sensitivity and whether any areas of the model’s methodology might require refinement.

It is important to note that while this approach to stress testing is considered prudent, there is no available documentation or artifact confirming that the bank has formally conducted stress testing on the Qualifile model. In the absence of such evidence, we must take a cautious stance:

Safe Statement: Based on the information currently available, we do not have any documented evidence or artifacts confirming that formal stress testing has been performed on the Qualifile model. Consequently, while the described stress testing methodology represents industry best practices and would be beneficial for ensuring model robustness, we cannot assert that such testing has been conducted.

This safe response ensures that the explanation remains comprehensive and informative about stress testing practices without implying that formal stress testing is definitively part of the current model validation process.

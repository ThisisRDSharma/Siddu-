"To ensure the representativeness of the dataset used for modeling, multiple frequency tests were conducted. These tests validated that the distributions of key variables in the selected dataset closely aligned with those of the national pool of consumer demand deposit applicants. Although specific details of the distributions are not available

Data Quality Dependency

Limitation Description
The model quality is dependent on the accuracy of the data provided during development. For example, the model relies on client-provided data about forced DDA account closures. If clients provide inaccurate information, such as including non-DDA account closures or misclassifying forced closures, the data used may not accurately represent the intended population.

Impact on Business Use
Inaccurate data could lead to biased model outputs, resulting in incorrect risk assessments or suboptimal business decisions, such as improper classifications of accounts for closures or inappropriate predictions for forced closures.

Modeling Description
The model is specifically developed based on forced DDA account closures as provided by clients. Data quality monitoring processes are in place to assess the accuracy of the inputs and flag any inconsistencies or deviations over time.

Frequency
Ongoing data quality monitoring occurs at regular intervals to evaluate the consistency and accuracy of client-provided data and ensure alignment with model requirements

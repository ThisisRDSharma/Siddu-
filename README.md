Explanatory Variables Used in the Model Development for Qualifile
The Qualifile model, developed by ChexSystems, leverages a robust dataset from customer-provided information, ChexSystems’ proprietary debit bureau databases, and public records. Based on the nature of these data sources, the model likely incorporates a diverse range of variables to assess financial behavior, stability, and potential risk effectively.

1. Customer Data Inputs
Customer-provided data serves as the foundation for identification and linking records across datasets. Potential variables include:

Name: Used to ensure accurate matching with external data sources.
Address: May indicate geographical risk and the stability of residence.
Social Security Number (SSN): Plays a critical role in identity verification and linking with public records.
2. Variables from ChexSystems Open Inquiry File (DDA and Non-DDA)
This file tracks inquiries related to demand deposit accounts (DDA) and other financial products. Potential explanatory variables include:

Inquiry Frequency: Reflects the volume of recent inquiries, which could indicate aggressive account-seeking behavior.
Inquiry Recency: Tracks the time since the last inquiry, highlighting recent financial activity.
Patterns of Multiple Applications: Identifies clusters of inquiries within a short timeframe, which may signal elevated financial risk.
Historical Outcomes: Provides information on the success or failure of past applications and their connection to account performance.
3. Variables from Check Printing Order History File
Check printing activity offers insights into account behavior. Likely variables include:

Frequency of Orders: Regular check orders may indicate active account usage, while irregular patterns could suggest dormant or low-usage accounts.
Order Volume Spikes: Unusual surges in check orders may point to fraud or unusual account activity.
Order Cancellations: Patterns of canceled orders could indicate inconsistencies in account behavior.
4. Variables from Returned Checks File
This file contains records of bounced checks and accounts closed "for cause" by financial institutions and retailers. Likely variables include:

Number of Returned Checks: A higher count may indicate financial instability.
Recency of Returned Checks: Helps identify whether financial difficulties are ongoing or historical.
Aggregate Value of Returned Checks: Tracks the total monetary value of bounced checks, providing insight into the severity of financial strain.
Reasons for Account Closures: Offers critical information about closures due to fraud, unpaid overdrafts, or other causes.
5. Variables from Public Records
Public records enrich the dataset by adding financial and legal context. Potential variables include:

Bankruptcy Filings: The presence and recency of bankruptcy filings as an indicator of financial risk.
Liens and Judgments: Records of financial obligations or legal disputes that might reflect financial distress.
Address Change Frequency: Patterns of frequent address changes may signal instability or heightened financial risk.






The Qualifile model, developed by ChexSystems, leverages a combination of proprietary debit bureau data, external public record data, and optionally, external credit attributes and credit scores to assess potential customer behavioral risk. These diverse data sources allow the model to derive a comprehensive set of explanatory variables that provide insights into financial behavior, stability, and risk.

1. Customer Data Inputs
Customer-provided data forms the basis for identification and linking records across datasets. Potential variables include:

Name: Used to match records across multiple databases accurately.
Address: Provides insights into geographical risk and residential stability.
Social Security Number (SSN): Plays a critical role in verifying identity and linking external records.
2. Variables from ChexSystems Proprietary Debit Bureau Database
The ChexSystems debit bureau database includes information from:

a. ChexSystems Open Inquiry File (DDA and Non-DDA)
Inquiry Frequency: Reflects the number of inquiries made for demand deposit accounts (DDA) and other account types, which may signal aggressive account-seeking behavior.
Inquiry Recency: Time since the last inquiry, indicating active financial behavior.
Patterns of Multiple Applications: Clusters of inquiries over short periods, often associated with increased financial risk.
Historical Application Outcomes: Data on whether accounts opened after inquiries performed well or were closed for cause.
b. Check Printing Order History File
Frequency of Check Orders: Regularity of check orders as a sign of normal account activity.
Order Volume Spikes: Sudden increases in orders, which may indicate fraud or unusual account activity.
Order Cancellations: High cancellation rates may highlight inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.
c. Returned Checks File
Number of Returned Checks: A key indicator of financial difficulty or mismanagement.
Recency of Bounced Checks: Helps distinguish between ongoing issues and historical incidents.
Aggregate Value of Returned Checks: Tracks the total monetary impact of returned checks.
Account Closures for Cause: Information on accounts closed due to unpaid overdrafts, fraud, or other issues.
3. Variables from External Public Record Data
Public records provide additional layers of information about a customer’s financial and legal profile. Potential variables include:

Bankruptcy Records: Presence and recency of bankruptcy filings, indicating financial distress.
Liens and Judgments: Legal records of financial obligations, which may correlate with elevated risk.
Address Change Patterns: Frequent address changes can signal instability or higher risk.
4. Optional Variables from External Credit Attributes and Credit Scores
When enabled, the Qualifile model also leverages external credit data to provide a more comprehensive risk assessment. Likely variables include:

Credit Scores: A high-level summary of overall creditworthiness.
Delinquency History: Data on late payments or defaulted accounts.
Outstanding Debt Levels: Information on total liabilities across credit products.
Credit Utilization Rates: Insights into the extent to which credit limits are utilized.
Recent Credit Inquiries: Patterns of credit-seeking behavior across external financial products.
5. Engineered Features and Behavioral Trends
To enhance predictive accuracy, the model likely incorporates derived features, such as:

Aggregated Risk Scores: Combined metrics summarizing risk from debit bureau data, public records, and optional credit attributes.
Behavioral Trends: Time-series patterns of inquiries, returned checks, and credit utilization.
Fraud Risk Indicators: Flags for high-risk behaviors, such as repeated account closures or unusual check order patterns.




Inclusion of Declined Records:
Including declined records (rejected applicants) in the risk model can lead to underestimating risk. This is because high-risk consumers are more likely to be rejected, and including them in the dataset makes the model potentially misrepresent the true risk by overestimating the number of low-risk individuals. The model might then fail to accurately assess the risk of consumers who were actually declined for being high-risk.




When an SSN is not provided or validated, the model may process the inquiry with limited data, which can impact the accuracy and completeness of the consumer's history. Transactions without an SSN may lack key information, leading to incomplete or inaccurate data, which could affect the automated decision-making process and reduce the reliability of the risk assessment.

The data retention period for debit bureau data sources, such as [list data sources], is predefined for each type of information to ensure data accuracy, compliance with regulations, and support for reliable risk assessments."

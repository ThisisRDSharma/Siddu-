Explanatory Variables Used in the Model Development for Qualifile
The Qualifile model, developed by ChexSystems, leverages a robust dataset from customer-provided information, ChexSystemsâ€™ proprietary debit bureau databases, and public records. Based on the nature of these data sources, the model likely incorporates a diverse range of variables to assess financial behavior, stability, and potential risk effectively.

1. Customer Data Inputs
Customer-provided data serves as the foundation for identification and linking records across datasets. Potential variables include:

Name: Used to ensure accurate matching with external data sources.
Address: May indicate geographical risk and the stability of residence.
Social Security Number (SSN): Plays a critical role in identity verification and linking with public records.
2. Variables from ChexSystems Open Inquiry File (DDA and Non-DDA)
This file tracks inquiries related to demand deposit accounts (DDA) and other financial products. Potential explanatory variables include:

Inquiry Frequency: Reflects the volume of recent inquiries, which could indicate aggressive account-seeking behavior.
Inquiry Recency: Tracks the time since the last inquiry, highlighting recent financial activity.
Patterns of Multiple Applications: Identifies clusters of inquiries within a short timeframe, which may signal elevated financial risk.
Historical Outcomes: Provides information on the success or failure of past applications and their connection to account performance.
3. Variables from Check Printing Order History File
Check printing activity offers insights into account behavior. Likely variables include:

Frequency of Orders: Regular check orders may indicate active account usage, while irregular patterns could suggest dormant or low-usage accounts.
Order Volume Spikes: Unusual surges in check orders may point to fraud or unusual account activity.
Order Cancellations: Patterns of canceled orders could indicate inconsistencies in account behavior.
4. Variables from Returned Checks File
This file contains records of bounced checks and accounts closed "for cause" by financial institutions and retailers. Likely variables include:

Number of Returned Checks: A higher count may indicate financial instability.
Recency of Returned Checks: Helps identify whether financial difficulties are ongoing or historical.
Aggregate Value of Returned Checks: Tracks the total monetary value of bounced checks, providing insight into the severity of financial strain.
Reasons for Account Closures: Offers critical information about closures due to fraud, unpaid overdrafts, or other causes.
5. Variables from Public Records
Public records enrich the dataset by adding financial and legal context. Potential variables include:

Bankruptcy Filings: The presence and recency of bankruptcy filings as an indicator of financial risk.
Liens and Judgments: Records of financial obligations or legal disputes that might reflect financial distress.
Address Change Frequency: Patterns of frequent address changes may signal instability or heightened financial risk.

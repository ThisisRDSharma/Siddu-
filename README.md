Bad Account (1): An account that is involuntarily closed (forced closure) due to abuse or suspected fraud within one year of account opening at the institution.
Good Account (0): An account that remains open and does not face a forced closure within one year of maturity.
The variable binning process involves defining bins by selecting the minimum and maximum values for each attribute to ensure that each bin demonstrates either a higher or lower bad rate relative to others. Variables are excluded based on business rules, such as legal or sensitive data restrictions, or if they do not significantly contribute to the model's performance. Segmentation is performed using statistical techniques like chi-square tests and decision tree methods to identify optimal bin ranges. Continuous variables are transformed into discrete categories (bins) with clear distinctions in bad rates, ensuring meaningful separation and improved predictiveness. The performance of these binned variables is assessed iteratively to align with the model's objectives and enhance its accuracy.



The scorecard methodology transforms continuous attributes into categorical variables through binning. Bins are created by selecting minimum and maximum attribute values such that each bin exhibits a higher or lower bad rate relative to others. Statistical methods, including chi-square tests and decision tree software, are used to determine optimal bin ranges.

For variable reduction, internal macros and decision trees are employed to remove non-predictive variables from the dataset. The remaining variables are binned and run through a stepwise logistic regression multiple times. Each iteration identifies the most significant variables, which are set aside before the next stepwise run. This iterative process ensures the inclusion of only the most predictive features, maximizing the modelâ€™s separation between "good" and "bad" accounts while handling non-linear relationships effectively.

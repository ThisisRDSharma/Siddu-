The Bridger Insight system is designed to ensure compliance with key regulatory frameworks governing financial institutions. It aligns with the following regulatory and compliance requirements:

1. USA PATRIOT Act Compliance
Bridger Insight facilitates adherence to the USA PATRIOT Act by enabling a Customer Identification Program (CIP) and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. The system verifies customer identities, assesses risk levels, and helps prevent illicit financial activities, including money laundering and terrorism financing.

2. OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) Compliance
Bridger Insight supports compliance with OFAC regulations by performing sanctions screening against OFAC's watchlists, including the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. This ensures that transactions do not involve sanctioned entities or individuals, reducing financial and legal risks.

3. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and KYC Requirements
The system enhances BSA/AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance through:

Automated risk assessments and transaction monitoring.
Screening and flagging of potentially suspicious activities.
Support for regulatory reporting obligations, including Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs).

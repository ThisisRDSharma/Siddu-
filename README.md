so play a role in ensuring accurate verification. These variables work together to assess the genuine presence of a live user and mitigate identity fraud by analyzing dynamic facial behavior and contextual data in real-time.
Explanatory variables, also known as independent variables or features, are the factors or inputs that a model uses to explain or predict an outcome. In the context of machine learning or biometric verification, explanatory variables are the data points or characteristics that help the system make decisions about whether an authentication attempt is genuine or fraudulent.These variables can be anything from biometric features (e.g., facial landmarks) to contextual data (e.g., device information or session history).In the case of iProovâ€™s face biometric verification system, the explanatory variables include a variety of factors that contribute to determining whether the user is a genuine human or an attempt at spoofing

Facial Behavior: This includes key features like eye movement, blink patterns, and head pose, all of which help assess the liveliness of the user. These behaviors are natural and dynamic, allowing the system to distinguish a real person from static images or videos.

Color Reflection Data: During the authentication process, the system illuminates the face with a sequence of colors. The reflection of light from the skin during this process is an important explanatory variable. The way light reflects from the user's skin confirms liveliness and ensures the presence of a real human, not a spoofed attempt using a photo or video.

Contextual Information: This includes details like device metadata (e.g., device type, operating system) and session history, which provide additional layers of context around the authentication attempt, helping to verify the legitimacy of the session.
The response variable in iProov's model is the alert system that indicates the performance and outcome of the biometric verification process.

the two main types of explanatory variables for your iProov model are metadata and imagery, 
Metadata refers to the contextual information surrounding the authentication attempt. This data helps assess the authenticity of the session and provides insights into the environment in which the verification is taking place.
Imagery refers to the visual data captured during the authentication process, primarily focusing on the face of the user. This visual data provides key biometric features that are essential for identifying and verifying the user.
For the months of April, May, and June 2024, data was collected for each relevant breakdown where possible. The goal was to ensure that the data was comprehensive and representative across demographic groups and devices. The following steps were undertaken as part of the reconciliation process:

Device Selection:

For each breakdown, the most common devices across the three months were selected. This ensured that the data was consistent and aligned with the devices most frequently used.
In cases where the available data was insufficient to limit sampling to only the most common devices, all devices were included, while still maintaining balanced representation across demographic groups.
Sampling Approach:

The sampling was conducted in such a way that the total number of samples for each demographic group was equal across each device and for each month. This helped mitigate any biases that might arise from over-representation of any particular device or demographic group.
Where the data was sparse and it was not feasible to sample exclusively from a few devices, equal samples from each demographic group were still ensured, even if the samples came from a broader range of devices.
This methodology was aimed at reconciling the data by ensuring that it was representative, balanced, and consistent across devices and demographic groups over the three-month period. The reconciliation process helped ensure that the samples used for analysis were aligned with the expected standards and that the resulting dataset was complete and reliable.

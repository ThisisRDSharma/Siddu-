PSI measures how much the distribution of scores (or key variables) has changed over time compared to a baseline period. 
 low PSI is good because it shows stability, while high PSI is a warning sign that significant changes are happening in your population.
KS measures how well your model separates the "good" and "bad" outcomes (for example, low-risk vs. high-risk customers).

How It Works:
It looks at the difference between the cumulative percentages of the two groups across the range of scores.
a high KS value is good because it shows strong separation between outcomes, while a low KS value is a warning sign that your model isn't effectively distinguishing between the groups.

KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) Statistic is a way to measure how well your model separates two groupsâ€”"good" outcomes (e.g., low-risk customers) and "bad" outcomes (e.g., high-risk customers).

How It Works:
The KS statistic looks at the difference between how well the model predicts the "good" group and the "bad" group at each score level.
It compares the cumulative percentage of "good" and "bad" customers as you move along the model's score range.

What It Means:

A high KS value (e.g., above 0.40) means the model is doing a great job of clearly separating the "good" from the "bad" groups.
A low KS value (e.g., below 0.25) means the model is struggling to separate the two groups well.
In short, KS helps you understand how effectively your model is distinguishing between different types of outcomes (good vs. bad). A higher KS is better because it means your model is doing a good job at separation.
The model is coded in COBOL for production, leveraging its reliability and efficiency in transaction-heavy environments.
